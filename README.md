# YouClient
Small web client for YouTube using the YouTube API. Currently not finished. Pull requests are welcome. When finished, a portable .html will be released.
Why?
* On the search page, when compared to YouTube, YouClient uses nearly 200MB of RAM less.
* YouClient can prevent certain blocker extensions from closing it
* YouClient can be embedded in an <iframe> or downloaded as a single .html file
* No slow, poorly made animations to slow you down

WARNING! YouClient is still in BETA and is not finished. It will change. Some features may be missing or bad.
